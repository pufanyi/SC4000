\section{Conclusion}

This project focuses on developing models for classifying cassava leaf diseases using advanced machine-learning techniques. It addresses challenges such as data imbalance and noise found in real-world datasets. By employing data augmentation, we combine traditional data pre-processing methods with advanced techniques like the Segment Anything Model. Additionally, we evaluated and integrated results from various model architectures, including \VIT, \CONV, and \CROP. By utilizing a soft voting algorithm, we were able to enhance classification accuracy and generalization.

Finally, our model achieved $90.95\%$ (Rank $4 / 3901$, Top $0.10\%$) on Public Benchmark and $90.60\%$ (Rank $2 / 3901$, Top $0.05\%$) on Private Benchmark. Detailed submission results and codes can be accessed in Appendix~\ref{app:submission_details}.
