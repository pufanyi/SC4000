With the advent of the 2020s AI era, it seems that all efforts have been focused on Transformers. However, we believe ResNet still holds its place. By leveraging a voting mechanism between ResNet and Transformer architectures, we may achieve different results. We propose a new model voting method to add a dimension for voting. In the Kaggle Cassava Leaf Disease Classification competition, our model achieved rank $4 / 3901$ on the Public Benchmark and rank $2 / 3901$ on the Private Benchmark. Our training code can be found in \href{https://github.com/pufanyi/SC4000}{GitHub} and all our models can be found in \href{https://huggingface.co/collections/pufanyi/sc4000-6717aaebf10b0e67e9a34a0d}{Hugging Face}.
